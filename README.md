## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Python 3 and higher is required + the  standard anaconda  runtime libraries

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this little EDA project that I completed as part of the Udacity Nano Degree programme 
I have chosen to use Stackoverflow Survey data for years 2019,2018 and 2017 in order to observe some of the trends and changes 
that have occured over the years.

The 3 questions that I  was interested in answering :
* What languages were most popular over the years?
* Are developers being encouraged to use more languages ?
* How have the desires around wanting to work with certain languages changed over 3 years?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available to demostrate the  code used for this analysis.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@jpasecnika/an-insight-into-what-developers-really-say-33107acd38b5).
